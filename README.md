# SpaceX Landing Outcomes Project

This repository contains a set of notebooks exploring the prediction of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landing success. The original project was split across multiple notebooks covering data collection, web scraping, wrangling, exploratory analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

`SpaceX_Complete_Project.ipynb` consolidates the workflow into a single notebook with sections for each step. Code cells illustrate how the data was gathered from the SpaceX API, combined with landing site information from Wikipedia, explored using SQL and Pandas, visualized in matplotlib/Folium, and finally used to train classification models.

The notebook includes explanatory markdown describing the purpose of each stage and summarizing the observed results of the analysis and model performance.
